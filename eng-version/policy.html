        <p>Customer satisfaction is one of the Company's priorities. Consequently, we offer our customers the option to apply for a refund in the event that they are not satisfied with our professional assistance services.</p>

        <p>The refund request will be evaluated within 24 hours since its receipt. Our Customer Service Department will review the reasons and the particular circumstances of your case to assess the approval or denial of the refund requested. In any case, the customer will be informed of the outcome of his/her request.</p>

        <h2>Refund Request Deadline</h2>
        <p>The Customer must make the refund request within a maximum period of 120 days of receiving our email confirming successful payment for our professional services.
